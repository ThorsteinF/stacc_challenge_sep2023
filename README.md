Technical details
-
For the front-end, I used HTML and CSS. I used PHP to communicate with a mysql server where I had imported the dataset. I added an extra column to the accounts table to store the savings goal. Once the savings goal is saved, it will be compared to the balance and calculate how far the customer is to reaching their goal. Then, the appropriate motivational image will be displayed. There are six of them in total. The project is running on a virtual private server hosted by Digitalocean.
