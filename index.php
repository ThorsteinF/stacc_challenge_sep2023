    <h3>This is my solution to the September 2023 Stacc challenge!</h3>
    <p>Getting people to save more money can be challenging! That's why I decided to motivate each customer with a motivational image showing
       how far they have gotten with their savings goal! It is possible to alter the savings goal if needed. Press the "accounts" tab to get started. 
       The source code and documentation can be found <a href = "https://github.com/ThorsteinF/stacc_challenge_sep2023">HERE</a></p>
